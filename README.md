**Molecular-property-prediction**
This project implements machine learning models to predict solubility from chemical structures.

**Project overview**
workflow of the project is as follows
- Process molecular data from the ESOL dataset
- Extract chemical features from molecular structures.
- Train traditional ML models (Random Forest)
- Implement Graph Neural Networks for molecular property-(solubility) prediction 
- Compare and evaluate model performance
